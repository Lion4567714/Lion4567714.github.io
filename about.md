Hello! I'm **Anders**. And this is a website. (Wow!)

I'm a 3rd-year student that goes to [Purdue University][purdue] to study **computer science**. More specifically, my interests are in learning how our computers work and doing side projects like this website. 

When I'm busy with schoolwork, I like to play **video games** and **hike**. Here's a few recommendations from me for both:

Games:
- [Factorio](https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/)
- [Terraria](https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/)
- [War Thunder](https://store.steampowered.com/app/236390/War_Thunder/)

Hikes and Nature Walks:
- [Tolt Hill](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/washington/tolt-hill-via-shinglewood-west-road-and-east-road-loop)
- [Cataract Falls](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/indiana/cataract-falls-via-ed-dailey-nature-trail)
- [Dragon's Tooth Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/virginia/dragon-s-tooth-from-miller-cove-rd)

**Music** is a very important part of my life. I've explored many genres, but I finally settled on a few including Japanese fusion and city pop, Soviet rock, and 70s soft rock. Here are some of the more meaningful artists to me:
