## How It Works
Most of the heavy lifting is done using the [Jekyll theme this website uses](https://github.com/Lion4567714/lions-jekyll-theme), so most of all that is left is writing the content of each page and configuring some basic information.

### Configuration
The important information is listed out in the `_config.yml` file. This includes author information, website structure, and jekyll plugins.

### Structure
The main pages `index.md` and `about.md` are in the base directory `/`.

Posts are contained in `/_posts/`. Posts filenames should be formatted like `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md`. Posts will automatically show up on the home page post listing.

Every page has YAML front matter enclosed with three dashes `---`. The front matter contains important information like page layout, title, date, and permalinks that should be filled out. You can read more about front matter on [Jekyll's website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/).
