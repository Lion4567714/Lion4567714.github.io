        <p>Hello! ðŸ‘‹ This is a brand-new website Iâ€™m cooking up during winter break this year. This post is just to outline what Iâ€™m doing here and what I plan for the future of this website.</p>

<h3 id="why-am-i-here">Why am I here?</h3>

<p>I dunno. You tell me. Iâ€™m surprised you even found this in the first place. <a href="mailto:lion@ablion.dev?subject=ablion.dev,%20Hello!">Come say hi</a>!</p>

<h3 id="why-are-you-making-this-website">Why are you making this website?</h3>

<p>I like doing side projects, and having a website seemed pretty cool to me, so here we are.</p>

<p>I had a website before this one that I made using React, Typescript, and TailwindCSS. I was inspired by the website of a good friend of mine <a href="https://www.loophole.engineer/">here</a>. Heâ€™s a serious web developer; I recommend checking his stuff out. Anyway, long story short, it ended up being a bigger project than I wanted or had time for. Soâ€¦</p>

<p>Here I am with a <em>new</em> website made through GitHub Pages and Jekyll. From the little I have done in the past couple days, it seems much easier to handle and it just looks good right off the bat.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-your-plans-for-this-site">What are your plans for this site?</h3>

<p>Primarily to learn and have fun. Secondarily, to post about the things I learn in a fun format. I would like this website to have more content and be better updated than my previous website project.</p>

<p>I think this website would also be a good place to post coding cheat sheets to refer back to in the future. I currently have a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax">GitHub markdown language cheat sheet</a> up as Iâ€™m writing this.</p>

<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h3>

<p>Thanks to anyone who came by to visit. Feel free to <a href="mailto:lion@ablion.dev?subject=ablion.dev,%20Hello!">contact me</a> and say hi. Hopefully this website stays relatively updatedâ€¦ ðŸ˜€</p>
