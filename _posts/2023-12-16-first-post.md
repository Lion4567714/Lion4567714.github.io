Hello! This is a brand-new website I'm cooking up during winter break this year. In this post, I want to outline what I'm doing here and what I plan for the future of this website.

### Why am I here?

I dunno. You tell me. I'm surprised you even found this in the first place. [Come say hi][hi]!

### Why are you making this website?

I like doing side projects, and having a website seemed pretty cool to me, so here we are.

I had a website before this one that I made using React, Typescript, and TailwindCSS. I was inspired by the website of a good friend of mine [here][willys website]. He's a serious web developer; I recommend checking his stuff out. Anyway, long story short, it ended up being a bigger project than I wanted or had time for. So...

Here I am with a *new* website made through GitHub Pages and Jekyll. From the little I have done in the past couple days, it seems much easier to handle and it just looks good right off the bat. 

### What are your plans for this site?

Primarily to learn and have fun. Secondarily, to post about the things I learn in a fun format. I would like this website to have more content and be better updated than my previous website project.

I think this website would also be a good place to post coding cheat sheets to refer back to in the future. I currently have a [GitHub markdown language cheat sheet][gh md sheet] up as I'm writing this.

### Closing Thoughts

Thanks to anyone who came by to visit. Feel free to [contact me][hi] and say hi. I look forward to working on this project further!
