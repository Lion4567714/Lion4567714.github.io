### Important note :warning:
Please take advantage of the SAVE and LOAD feature of the braindump site. Depending on how your browser settings are configured, you may lose your list if you close your browser or shut off your computer. *This website does not save your list for you*. Using the SAVE and LOAD feature will guarantee your list is not lost.

# So what is it?
Brain dumping is exactly what it sounds like. You simply take all the stuff you're keeping in your head, be it your daily chores, homework assignments, shopping list, and whatever other tasks you need to do, and write them all out on a piece of paper. Or--in this case--on a website.

The idea is to take all of these tasks and put them somewhere safe outside of your head. That way you can feel free to forget them, knowing that you can refer to your braindump list to remember them. It allows you to free up headspace for the tasks at hand, rather than tasks that you can handle later.

You can add and remove items from the list throughout your day. Braindumping is also an excellent way to visualize how much work you have left to do in the day.

## Personal note
As a college student, there are a lot of little things that I need to remember throughout my day. Taking multiple unrelated classes that don't follow the same schedule is what makes this extraordinarily difficult. This is on top of my daily chores, my social and professional lives, and whatever else comes up that day. It can become stressful very quickly if left unchecked. Hence why I use this braindumping technique.

By throwing out all of the stuff I have to remember on a list, I feel free to let go of the stress of remembering them all. It allows me to look at my tasks objectively and critically. Then I can tackle them one-by-one. Not to mention I find watching the list grow shorter a very gratifying experience.
