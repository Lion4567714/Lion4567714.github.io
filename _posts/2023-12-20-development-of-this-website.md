This post is mostly just for me so that I can keep track of what I want to do with this project. But if you are interested in how the project is going and what I have to think about as I'm developing it, feel free to continue reading. :wink:
## What's been done
- [x] Set up Jekyll
  - Website is functional
- [x] Publish website
  - It's available to everyone! Yay!
- [x] Created basis for custom Jekyll theme
  - I'm using a custom theme which gives me complete control over how the website looks
- [x] Better URLs (easier to read)
- [x] Easier emojis with [emoji plugin](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji)

## What's causing problems
- [ ] Separate configuration for development and production environments
  - With the current setup, I have to remember to fix the configuration files every time I update the website. This might involve customizing the building of the website on GitHub's end. Which will be interesting to say the least.
- [ ] Mobile support
  - "But the website looks great on my monitor!" -every web developer ever. Half of the people I asked to view my website used their phone.
- [ ] Finding a good, readable font
  - While [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) is awesome, their fonts are designed for nerds and their terminals. Which means not awesome for plain reading. I need to strike a balance between cool looking and legible.

## What needs doing
- [ ] Website and Jekyll theme documentation
  - Good luck following along with what I'm trying to do. The comments are few and far between
- [ ] "Date edited" tags on posts
  - Of the two posts that I have now, I've gone back to them on occasion to spiff them up. Sometimes it's important to know things have changed.
- [ ] Tags on posts
  - Helps organize things
- [ ] Sortings ports
  - By tag, title, date, etc.
