## Guides

For the most part, everything I have made has been with the help of these two resources.

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)

## Languages and How They're Used

- Ruby: package manager via gemfile
- Jekyll: brains of the operation
- YAML: configuration files
- SASS: style
- HTML: page structure
- Markdown: page contents
